 - Responds automatically to commonly asked questions

##### For the AlphaConsole Staff
The bot helps the AlphaConsole staff with lots of different things. 
Some examples would be user database lookups, auto spam/swear word protection, custom  commands, warning, timed mutes, bans, kicks & way more than I want to list.

For a breakdown of all commands you can go to `src\cmds` 
For a breakdown of event calls you can go to `src\events`

### Contributing 

If you are interested in contributing to this project it will require some setup. 

#### Tokens
You will need to create a `tokens.js` file in `src/`. Currently there is a template file called `tokens.example.js` if you prefer renaming that and using that.


#### ServerInfo

`serverInfo.js` contains all the channel ids. This may or may not need to be updated depending on what you are working on.

#### Database

We are using a MySQL database. You can link your details of your MySQL server in the `tokens.js` file.
You can copy the create statements from `tokens.example.js` if you would like to copy over the tables.


##### Please create a pull request into the `dev` branch :)
